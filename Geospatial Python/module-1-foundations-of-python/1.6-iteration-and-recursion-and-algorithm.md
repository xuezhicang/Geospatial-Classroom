# Iteration and recursion, and Algorithm







Iteration



```
// Some code

for



while
```



recursion



* Recursion (will revisit it later)

```
// Some code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))


```



Many people use it. but we should avoid it.\
